Welcome to the `animated-flag` repository!

This vertex-animated object is based on an original version by [trueDev](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/publishers/3641/truedev) (YoYoGames Marketplace Publisher Link). trueDev allowed me to republish the enhanced version as OpenSource -- credits to `trueDev` for their original version!

I enhanced this version in an object called `AnimatedFlag` that offers instance variables, scaling and room editor compatibility as well as some code optimizations for better readability.

With this object you can create stunning realtime effects from a single image!
Go, try it out!

## How to use

### First time users: Clone the repo and start the demo project
The repository contains a small demo project with a single room and some objects that show animated flags with different settings for speed, intensity and wave height.
Go to the room editor and double click some of the flags, so you can see, which runtime values are applied for the shown effects.

### Get the package
In the _Releases_ section of the repository you can find a history of releases of this object.
The packge contains only the necessary files to be imported in your project.
When importing, a `animated-flag` group is created in the root of your project. Move it to a location that fits your project best.
